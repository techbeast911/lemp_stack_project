This project details the process of setting up a LEMP stack on an AWS instance and concludes with successfully retrieving data from a MySQL database and displaying it on a webpage.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. Accessing the Instance:

    The guide starts by explaining how to SSH into your AWS instance using a Git Bash terminal and your .pem key file.

2. Installing Nginx:

    It then details how to install Nginx, a high-performance web server, using the sudo apt update and sudo apt install nginx commands. It also covers how to verify if Nginx is running successfully.

3. Troubleshooting Nginx Startup Issue:

    The project addresses a common issue where Nginx fails to start due to port 80 being already in use (potentially by Apache2). It provides solutions like stopping Apache2 and restarting Nginx.

4. Installing MySQL:

    It explains how to install MySQL, a relational database management system, using sudo apt install mysql-server. It also covers logging into the MySQL server and securing it by changing the root password.

5. Installing PHP:

    The guide details installing PHP and the PHP-FPM package using sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysql. PHP-FPM enhances performance for PHP applications.

6. Configuring Nginx for PHP:

    Here, the project dives into configuring Nginx to work with PHP. It explains creating a new server block for your website and setting up ownership permissions for the web directory.

7. Testing the LEMP Stack:

    This section covers testing the LEMP stack by creating an index.html file and accessing it through the instance's public IP address.

8. Validating PHP Processing:

    It demonstrates how to validate that Nginx can handle PHP files by creating a test PHP script (info.php) and accessing it in the browser.

9. Connecting to MySQL Database:

    The project showcases how to create a database and user in MySQL, grant permissions, and connect to the database using the created user credentials.

10. Retrieving Data and Displaying it on a Webpage:

    Finally, it demonstrates creating a PHP script (todo_list.php) that connects to the MySQL database, retrieves data from a table, and displays it as a bulleted list on a webpage.

Overall, this project provides a well-structured guide for setting up and testing a LEMP stack on an AWS instance. It includes troubleshooting steps and concludes with successfully retrieving and displaying data from a MySQL database.
